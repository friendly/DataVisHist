# README-figs for Friendly & Wainer

This zip file contains all the image files used in our book, Data Visualization: ...,
including our suggested cover image, small cartoon-like images used on chapter pages
and the images that are referred to as figures in the text.

Filenames of these figures refer to their content.  In the writing, it was too awkward
to number them sequentially, because adding or removing a figure would require that
all figures in a chapter be renamed.  Rather, all figure files and the corresponding
figure numbers are listed in the file `FigureList.txt`. Figures for ch X are contained
in the folder `ch X/figs`.
